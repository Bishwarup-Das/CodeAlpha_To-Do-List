Web Development:- TASK 1

TO DO LIST


I have made a To-Do List Task using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I added an "ADD" button to input the List or Task, i also give 2 option to add the task:-
(1) by mouse click &
(2) by pressing Enter Key.

I added check and uncheck option in list using Toggle in JavaScript.

I added JavaScript code in a cross-image for deleting a particular list from there.

I added Priority based sorting for the order of the task by taking priority from user.

I added Saving in localstorage in Browser for saving the list and the checked or unchecked reponses (doesn't matter if the browser is refreshed or closed by mistakes, Tasks remains safe).

Media Query supported for Mobile and Tab view too (i.e., Fully Responsive Web Application).


Thank You :)
